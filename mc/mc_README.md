## Description of the Microcontroller

<!-- This repository contains a code project that is a lightweight, highly extensible 
application that allows for plug and play for interfacing with a Raspberry Pi 
over IP to a controller computer, with sensors connected to the Pi - Nihal 
please clarify this section, and I will go over it and re-write it into laymans terms

This thang is in three components

Microcontroller used: stm32f103c8t6
Bootloader: stm32duino

Two identical microcontrollers are used to: 1)Control multiple solenoid valves and 2)Read analog sensors. The microcontrollers are connected to a Pi via the USB port and communicate via UART.
